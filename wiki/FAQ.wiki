== How do I make a shortcut to run PuTTYcyg? ==

Use this command line:
{{{
C:\path\to\puttycyg.exe -cygterm -
}}}
or use a saved session:
{{{
C:\path\to\puttycyg.exe -load Local
}}}
The [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html PuTTY documentation] has more information about how to use sessions.

== I have a non-Cygwin program which doesn't work under certain circumstances. What's wrong? ==

PuTTYcyg is not a Windows console replacement program, it is a local terminal emulator for Cygwin programs and therefore is only meant to work with Cygwin programs.  _Some_ Windows console programs will work _most_ of the time.  However, since PuTTYcyg does not provide a Windows console device, these console programs will break as soon as they try to access it (for example by trying to change the `ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT` setting via the `SetConsoleMode()` API function).  PuTTYcyg provides a POSIX pty in the Cygwin environment; it does not provide a Windows console device.

There are some excellent technical documents which explain why (non-Cygwin) Windows console programs don't work well in the absence of a Windows console device:
