== How do I make a shortcut to run PuTTYcyg? ==
Use this command line (_Target:_)
{{{
C:\path\to\putty.exe -cygterm -
}}}
or use a saved session, e.g.:
{{{
C:\path\to\putty.exe -load Local
}}}
Optional: set the working directory (_Start in:_) to your Cygwin installation's `/bin` directory: e.g.:
{{{
C:\Cygwin-1.7\bin
}}}
As of PuTTYcyg version 20090508, setting the working directory will allow you to turn off the _Autodetect Cygwin Installation_ and use multiple Cygwin installations on your system.

The [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html PuTTY documentation] has more information about how to use sessions.

== I have a non-Cygwin program which doesn't work under certain circumstances.  What's wrong? ==
PuTTYcyg is not a Windows console replacement program, it is a local terminal emulator for Cygwin programs and therefore is only meant to work with Cygwin programs.  _Some_ Windows console programs will work _most_ of the time.  However, since PuTTYcyg does not provide a Windows console device, these console programs will break as soon as they try to access it (for example by trying to change the `ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT` setting via the `SetConsoleMode()` API function).  PuTTYcyg provides a POSIX pty in the Cygwin environment; it does not provide a Windows console device.

There are some excellent technical documents which explain why (non-Cygwin) Windows console programs don't work well in the absence of a Windows console device:

== I recently upgraded Cygwin, and now PuTTYcyg no longer works. ==
The problem may be multiple copies of `cygwin1.dll`.  See [http://cygwin.com/faq/faq-nochunks.html#faq.using.multiple-copies the Cygwin FAQ].

== Troubleshooting: "Invalid Port number" ==
If the session registry has an old configuration, PuTTYcyg may not start properly.  Changing the `PortNumber` setting in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\_SESSION_` to `1` should solve the problem.

== Troubleshooting: "The procedure entry point blahblah could not be located in the dynamic link library cygwin1.dll" ==
This is a sure sign that your Cygwin installation predates 1.7.  Please upgrade to Cygwin 1.7 or use [http://puttycyg.googlecode.com/files/puttycyg-20071202.zip the last PuTTYcyg version which supports Cygwin 1.5 (20071202)].
