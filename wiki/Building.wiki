#summary Building PuTTYcyg

The released source packages of recent versions of PuTTYcyg (from 2007 and later) is released as a gzipped patch file.  The patch file itself is actually a shell script which can automagically download the [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html PuTTY source], patch it, and build PuTTYcyg (putty.exe and cthelper.exe).  Building it requires Cygwin with make, gcc-mingw, perl, and patch installed.  If you're feeling lucky:

{{{
zcat putty-0.60-cygterm-20071202.patch.gz | sh
}}}

If you're building from the repository, use these commands instead:

{{{
perl mkfiles.pl
make -C windows -f Makefile.cyg putty.exe
make -C windows/cthelper
size windows/putty.exe windows/cthelper/cthelper.exe
}}}
